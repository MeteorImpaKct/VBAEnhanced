VBAEnhanced is a library that can be imported to a VBAProject simply by importing 'VBAEnhanced.txt' with the VBAEditor.
Note that, currently, VBAEnhanced is coded to work on a 64-bit/VBA7 device.
VBAEnhanced was also coded & debugged in Powerpoint's VBAEditor, meaning that it would work better in Powerpoint than other Office programs like Word or Excel (feel free to test it outside of Powerpoint).
This library is currently in development and there isn't any guarantee that it will run without any errors (specially if you are using an old device).
Feel free to develop your own version and use it for your own purposes, as VBAEnhanced was originally coined as an extension for simplyfing VBA.

And no, VBAEnhanced is for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and not for Visual Basic (VB).
Just open Powerpoint, Word or Excel, create a new document and hit [ALT + F11].
